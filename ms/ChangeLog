	* tmac.s-newer-from-bwk: A newer version of the MS macros
	supplied by BWK.  Would probably need some fixing to make
	it work with groff. Did not solve the problem with .UL
	in the original document.

	* tmac.srefs: Fix printing of date in tech report references.
	Fix printing of "pp." and "p." in all references.

	* tmac.s: Change absolute paths to relative ones.
	Fix a numeric register reference that groff complains about.
